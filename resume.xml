                <para>
                    After initially writing integration libraries for OAuth social
                    identity providers, I took over development on the primary
                    backend component in large-scale redesign for the core user
                    management product written in Ruby on Rails. I participated in
                    design discussions with product management, developed the
                    initial test framework still used for product QA, and was
                    responsible for most of the server-side coding involving
                    integrating internal services and building a processor for a
                    user management DSL. As more, larger customers were brought
                    on to the product I worked with operations and software
                    egineers from other teams to tune performance of our
                    infrastructure to meet the necessary. As that project shifted
                    from development to maintenence I've transitioned to a team
                    writing Scala web services to tackle infrastructure management
                    problems the faced by the company as it grows.

                <para>
                    I developed an open source, network-multiplayer game framework
                    for academic use in experimental economics in conjunction with
                    lead developer James Pettit. The real-time framework was
                    implemented in Python used Redis on the backend for consistent
                    state management and a JSON protocal for client communication.
                    There was also some GUI programming with GTK, Wx, and Matplotlib.
